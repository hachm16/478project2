I verified the output with three checks.

First, I ran with a fixed seed (123), then confirmed each row
follows arrivalTime = (1 + 3index) + [0,4](offset).

Second, the file index increments by 1 and the row count equals 
requested sample count.

Finally, I reran with a different seed and observed different numbers.
